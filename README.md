## Interstellar spaceship

<h3>Shall we explore space together? Come with me on this adventure!</h3>

Greetings, Chief Archivist. The Interstellar Federation's central database has suffered a catastrophic quantum failure. We are left with nothing but raw data logs.

Your mission is to restore order to the archives. We have recovered fragments of data, but they are corrupted and disorganized. You must use your skills to reconstruct the database and ensure the safety of the Federation.
